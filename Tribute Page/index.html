                <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                    <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks
                        to a
                        Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                    <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                        Conservation
                        Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
                        scars on me."
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                    <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
                        cuts.
                        Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
                        about breeding
                        pest-resistent plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
                        rejected.
                        Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                        disinfectants, and
                        other applied science. </li>
                    <li>...</li>
